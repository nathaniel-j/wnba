# wnba
exploration into matplotlib graphing using wnba dataset.

In this repository I was just looking to explore some of the possibilities with matplotlib. In another dataset I had struggled with how to plot out multiple charts on one figure for easy comparison so I decided to go back and do some exploration. First I was just putting in some data and plotting it. Then I decided to do some work with a dataset I had come across in a course I had taken on Data Quest that has 33 columns of variables for all the players in the WNBA during the 2016 season. This data set has been pretty well combed over so I am not really looking for any new insights as much as I was just looking for a reasonable sized data set with a bunch of different types of data to look at. I will probably come back to this data set and poke around as I learn about new visualizations that I want to explore. 

the 'farting around with graphs' file was created as a Jupyter Notebook file so it is saved as an HTML file and rendered here as a webpage. I used Jupyter Notebook as a way to show the coding I used, display the plots I was creating, and be able to use markdown to explain what I was doing in place.
